The generate-sitemap GitHub action generates a sitemap for a website hosted on GitHub
Pages, and has the following features:
* Support for both xml and txt sitemaps (you choose using one of the action's inputs). 
* When generating an xml sitemap, it uses the last commit date of 
  each file to generate the `<lastmod>` tag in the sitemap entry. 
* Supports URLs for html and pdf files in the sitemap, and has inputs 
  to control the included file types (defaults include both html and pdf files in the sitemap).
* Now also supports including URLs for a user specified list of 
  additional file extensions in the sitemap. 
* Checks content of html files for `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` 
  directives, excluding any that do from the sitemap. 
* Parses a robots.txt, if present at the root of the website, excluding 
  any URLs from the sitemap that match `Disallow:` rules for `User-agent: *`.
* Sorts the sitemap entries in a consistent order, such that the URLs are 
  first sorted by depth in the directory structure (i.e., pages at the website 
  root appear first, etc), and then pages at the same depth are sorted alphabetically. 
* It assumes that for files with the name `index.html` that the preferred URL for the page
  ends with the enclosing directory, leaving out the `index.html`. For example,
  instead of `https://WEBSITE/PATH/index.html`, the sitemap will contain
  `https://WEBSITE/PATH/` in such a case.  

The generate-sitemap GitHub action is designed to be used 
in combination with other GitHub Actions. For example, it 
does not commit and push the generated sitemap. See 
the [Examples](#examples) for examples of combining
with other actions in your workflow.

The generate-sitemap action is for GitHub Pages sites,
such that the repository contains the html, etc of the 
site itself, regardless of whether or not the html was 
generated by a static site generator or written by 
hand. For example, I use it for multiple Java project 
documentation sites, where most of the site is generated 
by javadoc. I also use it with my personal website, which 
is generated with a custom static site generator. As long as
the repository for the GitHub Pages site contains the
site as served (e.g., html files, pdf files, etc), the 
generate-sitemap action is applicable.

The generate-sitemap action is not for GitHub Pages 
Jekyll sites (unless you generate the site locally and 
push the html output instead of the markdown, but why would 
you do that?). In the case of a GitHub Pages Jekyll site, 
the repository contains markdown, and not the html that 
is generated from the markdown. The generate-sitemap action 
does not support that use-case. If you are looking to generate 
a sitemap for a Jekyll website, there is 
a [Jekyll plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap) for that. 

## Requirements

This action relies on `actions/checkout@v2` with `fetch-depth: 0`.
Setting the `fetch-depth` to 0 for the checkout action ensures
that the `generate-sitemap` action will have access to the commit
history, which is used for generating the `<lastmod>` tags in the
`sitemap.xml` file.  If you instead use the default when applying the
checkout action, the `<lastmod>` tags will be incorrect.  So be
sure to include the following as a step in your workflow:

```yml
    steps:
    - name: Checkout the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0 
```

## Inputs

### `path-to-root`

The path to the root of the website relative to the
root of the repository. Default `.` is appropriate in most cases,
such as whenever the root of your Pages site is the root of the
repository itself. If you are using this for a GitHub Pages site
in the `docs` directory, such as for a documentation website, then
just pass `docs` for this input.

### `base-url-path`

This is the url to your website. You must specify this
for your sitemap to be meaningful.  It defaults
to `https://web.address.of.your.nifty.website/` for demonstration
purposes.

### `include-html`

This flag determines whether html files are included in
your sitemap (files with an extension of either `.html` 
or `.htm`). Default: `true`.

### `include-pdf`

This flag determines whether pdf files are included in
your sitemap. Default: `true`.

### `additional-extensions`

If you want to include URLs to other document types, you can use
the `additional-extensions` input to specify a list (separated by
spaces) of file extensions. For example, Google (and other search
engines) index a variety of other file types, including `docx`, `doc`,
source code for various common programming languages, etc. Here
is an example:

```yml
    - name: Generate the sitemap
      uses: cicirello/generate-sitemap@v1
      with:
        additional-extensions: doc docx ppt pptx
```

### `sitemap-format`

Use this to specify the sitemap format. Default: `xml`.
The `sitemap.xml` generated by the default will contain lastmod dates
that are generated using the last commit dates of each file. Setting 
this input to anything other than `xml` will generate a plain text 
`sitemap.txt` simply listing the urls.

## Outputs

### `sitemap-path`

The generated sitemap is placed in the root of the website. This 
output is the path to the generated sitemap file relative to the
root of the repository. If you didn't use the `path-to-root` input, then
this output should simply be the name of the sitemap file (`sitemap.xml`
or `sitemap.txt`).

### `url-count`

This output provides the number of URLs in the sitemap.

### `excluded-count`

This output provides the number of URLs excluded from the sitemap due
to either `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` within html files,
or due to exclusion from directives in a `robots.txt` file.

## Examples

### Basic Action Syntax

You can run the action with a step in yuor workflow like this:

```yml
    - name: Generate the sitemap
      uses: cicirello/generate-sitemap@v1
      with:
        base-url-path: https://THE.URL.TO.YOUR.PAGE/
```

In the above example, the major release version was used, which ensures that you'll
be using the latest patch level release, including any bug fixes, etc. If you prefer,
you can also use a specific version such as with:

```yml
    - name: Generate the sitemap
      uses: cicirello/generate-sitemap@v1.7.1
      with:
        base-url-path: https://THE.URL.TO.YOUR.PAGE/
```

### Example 1: Minimal Example

In this example workflow, we use all of the default inputs except for
the `base-url-path` input. The result will be a `sitemap.xml`
file in the root of the repository. After completion, it then
simply echos the outputs.

```yml
name: Generate xml sitemap

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  sitemap_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Generate a sitemap

    steps:
    - name: Checkout the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0 

    - name: Generate the sitemap
      id: sitemap
      uses: cicirello/generate-sitemap@v1
      with:
        base-url-path: https://THE.URL.TO.YOUR.PAGE/

    - name: Output stats
      run: |
        echo "sitemap-path = ${{ steps.sitemap.outputs.sitemap-path }}"
        echo "url-count = ${{ steps.sitemap.outputs.url-count }}"
        echo "excluded-count = ${{ steps.sitemap.outputs.excluded-count }}"
```

### Example 2: Webpage for API Docs

This example workflow illustrates how you might use this to generate
a sitemap for a Pages site in the `docs` directory of the
repository. It also demonstrates excluding `pdf` files, and
configuring a plain text sitemap.

```yml
name: Generate API sitemap

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  sitemap_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Generate a sitemap

    steps:
    - name: Checkout the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0 

    - name: Generate the sitemap
      id: sitemap
      uses: cicirello/generate-sitemap@v1
      with:
        base-url-path: https://THE.URL.TO.YOUR.PAGE/
        path-to-root: docs
        include-pdf: false
        sitemap-format: txt

    - name: Output stats
      run: |
        echo "sitemap-path = ${{ steps.sitemap.outputs.sitemap-path }}"
        echo "url-count = ${{ steps.sitemap.outputs.url-count }}"
        echo "excluded-count = ${{ steps.sitemap.outputs.excluded-count }}"
``` 

### Example 3: Including Additional Indexable File Types

In this example workflow, we add various additional types to the
sitemap using the `additional-extensions` input. Note that this
also include html files and pdf files since the workflow is using the
default values for `include-html` and `include-pdf`, which both default to
`true`.

```yml
name: Generate xml sitemap

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  sitemap_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Generate a sitemap

    steps:
    - name: Checkout the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0 

    - name: Generate the sitemap
      id: sitemap
      uses: cicirello/generate-sitemap@v1
      with:
        base-url-path: https://THE.URL.TO.YOUR.PAGE/
        additional-extensions: doc docx ppt pptx xls xlsx

    - name: Output stats
      run: |
        echo "sitemap-path = ${{ steps.sitemap.outputs.sitemap-path }}"
        echo "url-count = ${{ steps.sitemap.outputs.url-count }}"
        echo "excluded-count = ${{ steps.sitemap.outputs.excluded-count }}"
```

### Example 4: Combining With Other Actions

Presumably you want to do something with your sitemap once it is 
generated. In this example workflow, we combine it with the action
[peter-evans/create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request).
First, the `cicirello/generate-sitemap` action generates the sitemap. And
then the `peter-evans/create-pull-request` monitors for changes, and
if the sitemap changed will create a pull request.

```yml
name: Generate xml sitemap

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  sitemap_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Generate a sitemap

    steps:
    - name: Checkout the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0 

    - name: Generate the sitemap
      id: sitemap
      uses: cicirello/generate-sitemap@v1
      with:
        base-url-path: https://THE.URL.TO.YOUR.PAGE/

    - name: Create Pull Request
      uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
      with:
        title: "Automated sitemap update"
        body: > 
          Sitemap updated by the [generate-sitemap](https://github.com/cicirello/generate-sitemap) 
          GitHub action. Automated pull-request generated by the 
          [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) GitHub action.
```
